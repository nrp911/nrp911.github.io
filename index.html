		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Nexus RP: San Andreas (NRP:SA) is a multiplayer mod ("modification") for the Microsoft Windows version of Rockstar North's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas that adds an otherwise absent online multiplayer component.</p>
		<p>Although often referred to as a modification, Nexus RP is based on code injection and hooking techniques whereby the game is manipulated without altering any original files supplied with the game. The software functions as a game engine that installs itself as an extension of the original game, adding core functionality such as networking and GUI rendering while exposing the original game's engine functionality through a scripting language.</p>
		<p>Nexus RP's latest release is for the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and is built upon a now freeware game engine that has been in development for several years and is the only project that is still actively maintained. The engine provides users with all the necessary tools they need to create their own game modes and maps by exposing a large part of the original game functionality through a Lua scripting machine.</p>
